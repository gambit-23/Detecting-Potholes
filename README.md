# Pothole Detection System üöß

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a **Pothole Detection System** using **VGG16 Transfer Learning**. Leveraging deep learning and computer vision, this project identifies potholes in real-time from road images or videos, ensuring safer road conditions.

---

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes VGG16 with transfer learning for high-accuracy pothole detection.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes live video feeds or pre-recorded images.
- **Visual Outputs**: Displays bounding boxes around detected potholes.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for various road conditions and datasets.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python üêç
- **Libraries**: Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Model Architecture**: Pre-trained VGG16 for feature extraction
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for displaying results

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gambit-23/pothole-detection.git
   cd pothole-detection
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook:
